# No-Bob
 Chrome extension to remove Bob from popping up in Canvas.

# Installation
 The important folder you will need on your computer is "no-bob" that contains background.js, content.js, and manifest.json. Copy that somewhere helpful.

 In Chrome, go to chrome://extensions/ and make sure "Developer Mode" is enabled in the upper-right corner. Then click the "Load unpacked" button on the top left and select the "no-bob" folder.

 After loading the extension, which will be called "Canvas Chatbox Dismissal 1.0" in Chrome, there is a circular arrow button on the bottom-right corner of the extension box. Click that.

 Hopefully, every time you go to Canvas now Bob will close itself automatically upon popping up! If it doesn't...

# Ad Blockers
 This extension seems to have trouble running alongside some ad blocker extensions. I had to set AdBlock to remain paused on my Canvas page for every visit, and disable uBlock Origin for the same site. Turning those off made it work. Good luck!
